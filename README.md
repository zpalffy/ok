# ok
A very simple clone of my favorite command line utility that works well with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).  See [this post](https://secretgeek.net/ok) for the original inspiration.

> A `.ok` file holds a bunch of handy one-liners, specific to the folder it is in. It can be viewed or executed with a simple command. It makes you smarter and more efficient.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Source the `ok` file from your profile, e.g. I have `. ~/ok` in my `~/.zshrc` file.

## Usage
1. Create a `.ok` file in any directory you choose.  Fill it with any commands you use often or just want to remember.  See the included `.ok` file in this repo for some ideas.
2. Run the `ok` function in that directory to get a list of your saved commands
3. Run `ok #` to invoke any of those commands
